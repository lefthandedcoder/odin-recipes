    <h4>by Christian Dye, published December 27, 2021</h4>
    <p>Traditionally made with potatoes, flour, butter, and cream, this soft flatbread best served with sweet butter or whipped cream. Alternatively, lefse can be eaten with savory, salty foods. Throw out your dinner rolls and serve a platter of hot lefse for dinner tonight.</p>
