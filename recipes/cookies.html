    <h2>Winter Warmer Oatmeal Raisin Cookies</h3>
    <h4>by Christian Dye, published December 27, 2021</h4>
    <p>As winter howls down from the mountains and besets the land in a frigid embrace, nothing warms the hearth more than a welcoming plate of oatmeal cookies. Best served with fresh frothy milk, these cookies are a must for any winter occasion. Light the fire, pass around the plate, and gather round for tales of days gone by.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Yield: 26-30 cookies</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 c softened unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 c packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp molasses</li>
        <li>1 1/2 c flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>3 c rolled oats</li>
        <li>1 c raisins</li>
        <li>1/2 c chopped toasted walnuts</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cream softened butter and sugars until smooth. Add eggs and mix until combined. Scrape sides and bottom as needed. Add vanilla and molasses and mix until combined.</li>
        <li>In a seperate bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together. Add to wet ingredients and mix until combined. Add in oats, raisins, and walnuts. Chill for 30-60 minutes (Optional but helps cookies keep their form better).</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Roll balls of dough and place on baking sheets at spaced intervals. Bake for 12-14 minutes or until lightly browned on sides. Remove from oven and cool.</li>
    </ol>
