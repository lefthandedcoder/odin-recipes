    <h2>Lutefisk with Red Potatoes and Mashed Peas</h3>
    <h4>by Christian Dye, published December 27, 2021</h4>
    <p>Lutefisk, a staple of those now passed on to Valhalla found upon any decent julebord buffet, is a hearty dish of dried whitefish that has been pickled in lye. Gelatinous in texture, this dish has helped the people of Odin survive many a harsh and bitter winter. After it has been soaked in cold water for roughly 2 weeks, this fish is best served with potatoes, mashed peas, white sauce, mustard, and bacon. And of course, no meal tastes quite as good without a heavy mug of mead and the laughter of a good friend. Drink up and dig in!</p>
